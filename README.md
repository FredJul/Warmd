# Warmd - Fight climate change

![Banner](/raw_graphics/banner_full.png)

Warmd is a personal carbon footprint calculator which gives you an idea of your own impact and helps you to improve it with adapted advices. My only goal is to reduce a bit the human impact and to leave a habitable planet to our children.

It is a free and [open-source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) mobile application without any ads or paid features. You're are free to modify it as long as you respect the license and keep it open-source.
