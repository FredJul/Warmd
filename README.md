# Warmd - Fight climate change

![Banner](/raw_graphics/banner_full.png)

Warmd is a personal carbon footprint calculator which gives you an idea of your own impact and helps you to improve it with adapted advices. My only goal is to reduce a bit the human impact and to leave a habitable planet to our children.

It is a free and [open-source](LICENSE_CODE.txt) mobile application without any ads or paid features. However, graphics are under [Shutterstock Standard License](LICENSE_SVG.txt) and cannot be distributed outside Warmd.

## Contribute
You can help Warmd development by:
- improving or adding translations on [Crowdin](https://frju.crowdin.com/warmd) (you need to create a new account for the "Frju" organisation, existing Crowdin accounts will not work - see [this discussion](https://github.com/FredJul/Warmd/issues/37#issuecomment-784992109) if you have any issue). Please do not overuse the automatic translation feature since it makes a lot of mistakes, notably by modifying all links like (a http_link)text(/a).
- providing links of popular products or services that can help reducing your carbon footprint in a specific country (like www.backmarket.com for France). I'll try to establish some acceptance criterias later, for now I may arbitrary refuse some proposals.
- opening [tickets](https://github.com/FredJul/Warmd/issues/new) for bug reports or suggestions
- developing features and bugfixes

## How to compile?
Warmd is a Flutter project, meaning you need to [setup Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to be able to compile.

Warmd currently use Flutter beta 1.26.0-17.5.pre version and I recommand to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (with the official Flutter extension) since Warmd already contains some VSCode configuration files.
