    "heatingFuelCriteriaAdvice": "Try to better insulate your home and avoid heating more than necessary (an adult sleep quality is best at 66°F/19°C). Smart controls can help you switching off the heating when you are outside.\n\nAlso prefer heating with heat pump, with carbon-free electricity or with wood pellets from local and sustainable forests.",

    "meatCriteriaAdvice": "Adults don't need more than 2-3 meat meals per week (a bit more for kids). You should not exceed that number and consider that chicken is at least 3 times less polluting than beef.\n\nYou could even substitute meat with some vegetables rich in protein and iron such as lentils, quinoa, beans, tofu, seitan or even insects to help balance a healthy diet.
