SVG icons come from shutterstock.com with their Standard License.

Standard License allows for unlimited copies and digital distribution via Warmd (see https://www.shutterstock.com/support/article/Using-Images-in-software-apps-and-video-games?q=mobile&l=en_US&fs=Search&pn=1), but you are not allowed to use these SVGs outside of Warmd (you need to obtain a shutterstock license for your product as well).
